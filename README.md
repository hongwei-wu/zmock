# ZMock: Unit Test Mock Framework

ZMock is a lightweight and flexible mocking framework designed for unit testing in C. It allows you to create and manage mock objects, functions, and return values, enabling isolated testing of components without the need for actual dependencies. ZMock is particularly useful for testing modules with external dependencies, such as APIs, databases, or hardware components.

## Features

- **Mock Return Values**: Easily specify return values for functions.
- **Custom Function Wrappers**: Substitute function implementations with custom behaviors.
- **Mock Objects**: Generate mock objects with configurable properties and behaviors.

## Installation

To use ZMock in your project, download or clone the repository and include `zmock.h` and `zmock.c` in your project files. Make sure to link with any dependencies required by your unit testing framework.
